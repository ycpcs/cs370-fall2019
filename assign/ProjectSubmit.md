CS370 Final Project Submission Instructions:
============================================

1. Navigate to your final project directory, e.g. **CS370_Project**

2. Double-click the **.sln** file to load the project in Visual Studio.

3. Click the green arrow in the toolbar to build and run your project (be sure it runs properly on the KEC123 lab computers).

4. Close Visual Studio.

5. Navigate into the Debug directory located in the same folder as the **.sln** file.

6. Copy the **.exe** file from this directory.

7. Navigate up one directory - back to where the **.sln** file is.

8. Navigate into the directory with the source files, e.g. **CS370_Project** subdirectory. Be sure you are in the directory with the **.cpp** files, image files, shader files, etc.

9. Paste the **.exe** file in the folder with the source files.

10. Navigate out to the folder where the outermost project directory is, e.g. **H:/CS370**.

11. Insert a USB drive and open the drive folder.

12. Drag-and-drop the **CS370_Project** outermost folder into the USB folder.

13. After the folder has completed copying, eject the USB drive, reinsert it, open the USB folder, navigate into **CS370_Project/CS370_Project** (where the source files and executable are), and double-click on the executable file. Your program should execute WITHOUT launching Visual Studio.

14. Bring this USB drive to the final presentation during the final exam period along with the completed [evaluation form](CS370_Final_Project_eval.docx).
